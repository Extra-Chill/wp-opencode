# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Kimaki plugin: strip `--worktree` / `--cwd` examples and the per-turn "## worktree" block from the agent context. Data Machine Code owns the workspace and creates its own worktrees; leaving Kimaki's worktree language in the prompt caused the agent to try running work inside a Kimaki worktree instead of the DM Code workspace.

### Changed
- Kimaki plugin: also strip `## permissions` (Discord role metadata the agent can't act on) and `## upgrading kimaki` (the `/upgrade-and-restart` slash-command playbook — the user invokes it directly). `## debugging kimaki issues` is intentionally kept so the agent can find `kimaki.log` when Kimaki itself misbehaves.
