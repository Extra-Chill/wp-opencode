# Upgrade wp-coding-agents

`upgrade.sh` already auto-detects the environment, picks the chat bridge, prints a diff in dry-run, and emits the right verify + restart commands in its summary block. This skill exists for the **policy boundary** the script can't enforce on its own.

By default it also updates the setup-installed Data Machine plugins (`data-machine`, `data-machine-code`) to their latest version tags when those plugins are git checkouts. Use `--skip-plugins` to preserve the previous no-plugin-update behavior.

## When to use

The user says something like:
- "Upgrade wp-coding-agents"
- "Pull the latest plugin fixes onto this install"
- "My dm-context-filter.ts is out of date"
- "Regenerate AGENTS.md from the latest template"

## Procedure

1. **Find the repo and pull main:**
   ```bash
   cd "$(git -C ~/Developer/wp-coding-agents rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
   git pull origin main
   ```
   If the user maintains a fork or a feature branch, ask before pulling. Default is `origin/main`.

2. **Dry-run first.** Always.
   ```bash
   ./upgrade.sh --dry-run                      # VPS
   ./upgrade.sh --dry-run --wp-path /path      # local (auto-set on macOS)
   ```
   Read the output. Stop and investigate if anything looks wrong (wrong runtime, unexpected unit rewrite, plugin paths point somewhere weird).

3. **Apply** by dropping `--dry-run`. The script prints a summary with the exact verify + restart commands for the detected bridge × environment. Pass them through to the user verbatim — do not paraphrase, do not guess.

4. **Tell the user to restart the chat bridge themselves.** Active chat sessions die on restart, so the user picks the moment.

5. **After restart, verify Kimaki's OpenCode plugins when Kimaki + OpenCode are in use.** The summary's verify block includes a `test -f .../dm-context-filter.ts && test -f .../dm-agent-sync.ts` command. Run it or ask the user to run it, then inspect the Kimaki startup logs for `kimaki-config: WARNING:` lines. Any warning about a missing persistent plugin source dir or missing required OpenCode plugin means `opencode.json` may reference plugin files OpenCode silently skipped.

6. **Verify the filter behavior from the repo when available.** Run:
   ```bash
   node tests/effective-prompt/run.mjs
   ```
   Passing output (`OK — ... scenario(s)`) proves `dm-context-filter` still strips the Kimaki-only prompt sections the Data Machine agent should not see. If this fails after a Kimaki upgrade, fix the filter or refresh snapshots intentionally before calling the upgrade healthy.

Run `./upgrade.sh --help` for scope flags (`--plugins-only`, `--skip-plugins`, `--kimaki-only`, `--skills-only`, `--agents-md-only`, `--repair-opencode-json`, etc.) and the full list of what the script touches and never touches.

## Never do

- **Never restart the chat bridge automatically.** It kills active sessions including the one you're talking in.
- **Never skip the dry-run** on a live install.
- **Never touch user state:** `opencode.json` (the script does additive-only repair), the WordPress DB, nginx, SSL certs, `~/.kimaki/` auth state and OAuth tokens, the DM workspace cloned repos, or agent memory files (`SOUL.md` / `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`).
- **Never hardcode workspace paths** (`/var/lib/...`, `/opt/...`, `/var/www/...`, `/root/...`) in commands you give the user. Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, `$(npm root -g)`, `$KIMAKI_DATA_DIR`, and the script's auto-detection.

## Source of truth

| Question | Where to look |
|---|---|
| What flags exist? | `./upgrade.sh --help` |
| What did the upgrade actually do? | The script's summary block (printed at the end of every run) |
| What's the right restart command for this bridge × env? | The summary block — rendered from `bridges/<name>.sh::bridge_restart_cmd` |
| What's the right verify command? | The summary block |
| What chat bridges are supported? | `bridges/_dispatch.sh::bridge_names` (auto-discovered from `bridges/*.sh` — currently kimaki, cc-connect, telegram) |
