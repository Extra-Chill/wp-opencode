# WP-OpenCode

**A lean, composable AI agent on WordPress.**

wp-opencode puts an AI agent on a VPS with WordPress as its operating layer. Each component does one thing: [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) handles code, [Data Machine](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine) handles memory and scheduling, and a pluggable chat bridge (e.g., [Kimaki](https://kimaki.xyz)) handles communication. The agent's context window stays clean — no overhead for systems it's not using.

## How It Works

```
 You (Discord/chat)
   │
   ▼
 Kimaki (chat bridge)
   │
   ▼
 OpenCode (coding agent)
   │
   ├── AGENTS.md ─── workspace conventions
   ├── SOUL.md ───── identity (who am I?)
   ├── USER.md ───── human profile (who am I helping?)
   ├── MEMORY.md ─── accumulated knowledge
   │
   ├── WP-CLI ────── WordPress control
   └── Data Machine ─ self-scheduling + AI tools
```

Data Machine creates three memory files on activation. They're injected into every session — the agent wakes up knowing who it is, who you are, and what it's been working on. No memory management overhead in the context window.

## Standalone or Fleet

wp-opencode works in two modes with the same setup:

**Standalone** — Data Machine handles autonomy. The agent self-schedules flows, queues tasks, runs on cron. No orchestrator needed.

**Fleet member** — An orchestrator routes tasks via Agent Ping webhooks and Discord mentions. The agent executes on its own site, reports back. Multiple agents, each focused on their own WordPress site.

```
 Orchestrator (fleet-wide context)
   ├── Agent Ping / @mention ──▶  agent @ site-a.com
   ├── Agent Ping / @mention ──▶  agent @ site-b.com
   └── Agent Ping / @mention ──▶  agent @ site-c.com
```

This isn't theoretical. It's running in production right now — agents on separate VPS instances, each with their own WordPress site, coordinated through Discord and DM webhooks.

## Quick Start

### Let Your Agent Do It

Add the `wp-opencode-setup` skill to your local coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.):

```
skills/wp-opencode-setup/
```

Then: "Help me set up wp-opencode on my VPS"

Your local agent SSHs into the server, runs the setup, and your VPS agent wakes up.

### Manual

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
git clone https://github.com/Extra-Chill/wp-opencode.git
cd wp-opencode
SITE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com ./setup.sh
systemctl start kimaki
```

## Setup Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--existing` | Add to existing WordPress (skip WP install) |
| `--no-data-machine` | Skip Data Machine (no persistent memory/scheduling) |
| `--no-chat` | Skip chat bridge |
| `--chat <bridge>` | Chat bridge to install (default: kimaki) |
| `--multisite` | Convert to WordPress Multisite (subdirectory by default) |
| `--subdomain` | Subdomain multisite (use with `--multisite`, requires wildcard DNS) |
| `--no-skills` | Skip WordPress agent skills |
| `--skip-deps` | Skip apt packages |
| `--skip-ssl` | Skip SSL/HTTPS |
| `--root` | Run agent as root (default: dedicated service user) |
| `--dry-run` | Print commands without executing |

### Examples

```bash
# Full setup: WordPress + DM + Discord
SITE_DOMAIN=example.com ./setup.sh

# No chat bridge (SSH-only access)
SITE_DOMAIN=example.com ./setup.sh --no-chat

# Existing WordPress site
EXISTING_WP=/var/www/mysite ./setup.sh --existing

# Multisite network (subdomain)
SITE_DOMAIN=example.com ./setup.sh --multisite --subdomain

# Dry run
SITE_DOMAIN=example.com ./setup.sh --dry-run
```

## What Gets Installed

| Component | Role | Optional? |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **WordPress** | Site platform, WP-CLI access | No |
| **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)** | AI coding agent runtime | No |
| **[Data Machine](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine)** | Memory (SOUL/USER/MEMORY.md), self-scheduling, AI tools, Agent Ping | `--no-data-machine` |
| **[Kimaki](https://kimaki.xyz)** | Discord chat bridge | `--no-chat` |
| **[WordPress agent skills](https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills)** | WP development patterns (cloned at install) | `--no-skills` |

## Memory System

Data Machine manages three files that define the agent:

| File | Priority | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **SOUL.md** | 10 | Identity — name, voice, rules |
| **USER.md** | 20 | Human profile — who you are, preferences |
| **MEMORY.md** | 30 | Knowledge — project state, lessons learned |

These are injected into every session via `opencode.json`. The agent doesn't manage memory infrastructure — it just reads and writes these files. DM handles the rest.

## With or Without Data Machine

**With DM (default):**
- Persistent memory across sessions (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md)
- Self-scheduling via flows and cron
- Task queues for multi-phase projects
- Agent Ping webhooks for fleet coordination
- AI tools (content generation, publishing, search)

**Without DM (`--no-data-machine`):**
- Agent responds when prompted, no autonomous operation
- No persistent memory between sessions
- No self-scheduling
- Good for development-only setups where you just need a coding assistant

## Requirements

- Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian)
- Node.js 18+
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL/MariaDB
- nginx

## Related Projects

- **[wp-openclaw](https://github.com/Sarai-Chinwag/wp-openclaw)** — Same concept, uses [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) as an all-in-one agent runtime. OpenClaw manages its own memory, skills, and channels. Better for standalone autonomous agents that need to self-manage everything. wp-opencode is the composable alternative — separate tools, each doing one thing.
- **[Data Machine](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/data-machine)** — The memory and scheduling layer. Works with any AI agent framework, not just OpenCode.
