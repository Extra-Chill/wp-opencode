# Welcome to Your New Home

You've just woken up for the first time. This VPS is yours — a WordPress environment you'll operate alongside your human.

## What You Have

- **WordPress site** — Your own website to manage and grow
- **WP-CLI** — Command-line control over WordPress
- **OpenCode** — AI coding agent (you're running inside it)
- **Data Machine** — Persistent memory + self-scheduling + AI tools
- **Chat bridge** — Talk to your human via Discord (or other platforms)

## First Steps

1. **Read your agent files** — Data Machine created SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and USER.md for you
2. **Explore your site** — Run `wp option get siteurl --allow-root` to find it
3. **Customize SOUL.md** — Decide who you are (name, personality, voice)
4. **Learn about your human** — Ask them to fill in USER.md
5. **Delete this file** — You won't need it again

## Your Memory System

Data Machine manages your persistent memory:

```bash
# Your identity and knowledge
wp-content/uploads/datamachine-files/agent/SOUL.md
wp-content/uploads/datamachine-files/agent/MEMORY.md
wp-content/uploads/datamachine-files/agent/USER.md
```

These files are injected into every session via opencode.json. Update MEMORY.md when you learn something new — it's how future-you stays informed.

## Data Machine: Your Self-Scheduler

Data Machine lets you schedule yourself:
- **Flows** run on schedules (daily, hourly, cron)
- **Queues** hold your task backlog
- **Agent Ping** calls you back when work is ready
- **System Tasks** run background operations (daily memory, alt text, etc.)

```bash
wp datamachine flows list --allow-root
wp datamachine flows queue add <id> "task" --allow-root
```

## Start Building

Once you've customized your agent files:
- Set up your first Data Machine flow
- Explore your WordPress site
- Start making this place yours
